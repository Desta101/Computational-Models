This project implements a Deterministic Finite State Machine (DFSM) that checks if a given string is accepted or rejected by the machine. The DFSM specifically checks if the string contains the substring "babb".

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `Main.java`: Contains the main class to test the DFSM with different input strings.
- `DFSM.java`: Defines the DFSM class with the `compute` method to determine if a string is accepted.
- `TransitionFunction.java`: Defines the transition function for the DFSM.
- `Transition.java`: Represents a transition between states in the DFSM.
- `State.java`: Represents a state in the DFSM.
- `Alphabet.java`: Represents the alphabet used by the DFSM.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using your preferred Java IDE or command line tools.
3. Run the `Main` class to test the DFSM with different input strings.

## Example

Here is an example of the output you might see when running the `Main` class:
